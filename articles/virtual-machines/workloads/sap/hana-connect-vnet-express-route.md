# <a name="connect-a-virtual-network-to-hana-large-instances"></a>가상 네트워크를 HANA 대규모 인스턴스에 연결

Azure 가상 네트워크를 만든 후 해당 네트워크를 Azure 대규모 인스턴스의 SAP HANA에 연결합니다. 가상 네트워크에 Azure ExpressRoute 게이트웨이를 만듭니다. This gateway enables you to link the virtual network to the ExpressRoute circuit that connects to the customer tenant on the HANA Large Instance stamp.

> [!NOTE] 
> 이 단계를 완료하려면 최대 30분이 걸릴 수 있습니다. 새 게이트웨이는 지정된 Azure 구독에 만들어진 다음, 지정된 Azure 가상 네트워크에 연결됩니다.

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

게이트웨이가 이미 있는 경우 ExpressRoute 게이트웨이인지 여부를 확인합니다. If it is not an ExpressRoute gateway, delete the gateway, and re-create it as an ExpressRoute gateway. ExpressRoute 게이트웨이가 이미 설정된 경우 이 문서의 다음 섹션 "가상 네트워크 연결"을 참조하세요. 

- [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) 또는 PowerShell을 사용하여 가상 네트워크에 연결된 ExpressRoute VPN 게이트웨이를 만듭니다.
  - Azure Portal을 사용하는 경우 새 **가상 네트워크 게이트웨이**를 추가한 다음, 게이트웨이 유형으로 **ExpressRoute**를 선택합니다.
  - PowerShell을 사용하는 경우 먼저 최신 [Azure PowerShell SDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/)를 다운로드하여 사용합니다. 
 
다음 명령은 ExpressRoute 게이트웨이를 만듭니다. The texts preceded by a _$_ are user-defined variables that should be updated with your specific information.

```powershell
# These Values should already exist, update to match your environment
$myAzureRegion = "eastus"
$myGroupName = "SAP-East-Coast"
$myVNetName = "VNet01"

# These values are used to create the gateway, update for how you wish the GW components to be named
$myGWName = "VNet01GW"
$myGWConfig = "VNet01GWConfig"
$myGWPIPName = "VNet01GWPIP"
$myGWSku = "HighPerformance" # Supported values for HANA large instances are: HighPerformance or UltraPerformance

# These Commands create the Public IP and ExpressRoute Gateway
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $myVNetName -ResourceGroupName $myGroupName
$subnet = Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'GatewaySubnet' -VirtualNetwork $vnet
New-AzPublicIpAddress -Name $myGWPIPName -ResourceGroupName $myGroupName `
-Location $myAzureRegion -AllocationMethod Dynamic
$gwpip = Get-AzPublicIpAddress -Name $myGWPIPName -ResourceGroupName $myGroupName
$gwipconfig = New-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayIpConfig -Name $myGWConfig -SubnetId $subnet.Id `
-PublicIpAddressId $gwpip.Id

New-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $myGWName -ResourceGroupName $myGroupName -Location $myAzureRegion `
-IpConfigurations $gwipconfig -GatewayType ExpressRoute `
-GatewaySku $myGWSku -VpnType PolicyBased -EnableBgp $true
```

이 예제에서는 HighPerformance 게이트웨이 SKU를 사용했습니다. 옵션은 Azure(대규모 인스턴스)의 SAP HANA에 대해 지원되는 유일한 게이트웨이 SKU인 HighPerformance 또는 UltraPerformance입니다.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Type II 클래스 SKU의 HANA 대규모 인스턴스의 경우, UltraPerformance 게이트웨이 SKU를 사용해야 합니다.

## <a name="link-virtual-networks"></a>가상 네트워크 연결

이제 Azure 가상 네트워크에 ExpressRoute 게이트웨이가 만들어졌습니다. Use the authorization information provided by Microsoft to connect the ExpressRoute gateway to the SAP HANA Large Instances ExpressRoute circuit. Azure Portal 또는 PowerShell을 사용하여 연결할 수 있습니다. The PowerShell instructions are as follows. 

Run the following commands for each ExpressRoute gateway by using a different AuthGUID for each connection. 다음 스크립트에 표시된 처음 두 항목은 Microsoft에서 제공하는 정보에서 가져옵니다. 또한 AuthGUID는 모든 가상 네트워크 및 해당 게이트웨이에 지정됩니다. If you want to add another Azure virtual network, you need to get another AuthID for your ExpressRoute circuit that connects HANA large instances into Azure from Microsoft. 

```powershell
# Populate with information provided by Microsoft Onboarding team
$PeerID = "/subscriptions/9cb43037-9195-4420-a798-f87681a0e380/resourceGroups/Customer-USE-Circuits/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/Customer-USE01"
$AuthGUID = "76d40466-c458-4d14-adcf-3d1b56d1cd61"

# Your ExpressRoute Gateway information
$myGroupName = "SAP-East-Coast"
$myGWName = "VNet01GW"
$myGWLocation = "East US"

# Define the name for your connection
$myConnectionName = "VNet01GWConnection"

# Create a new connection between the ER Circuit and your Gateway using the Authorization
$gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $myGWName -ResourceGroupName $myGroupName
    
New-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name $myConnectionName `
-ResourceGroupName $myGroupName -Location $myGWLocation -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $gw `
-PeerId $PeerID -ConnectionType ExpressRoute -AuthorizationKey $AuthGUID -ExpressRouteGatewayBypass
```

> [!NOTE]
> The last parameter in the command New-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection, **ExpressRouteGatewayBypass** is a new parameter that enables ExpressRoute Fast Path. A functionality that reduces network latency between your HANA Large Instance units and Azure VMs. The functionality got added in May 2019. For more details, check the article [SAP HANA (Large Instances) network architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-network-architecture). Make sure that you are running the latest version of PowerShell cmdlets before running the commands.

게이트웨이를 구독과 연결된 두 개 이상의 ExpressRoute 회로에 연결하려면 이 단계를 두 번 이상 실행해야 할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 가상 네트워크를 온-프레미스 네트워크에 연결하는 ExpressRoute 회로에 동일한 가상 네트워크 게이트웨이를 연결해야 할 가능성이 높습니다.

## <a name="applying-expressroute-fast-path-to-existing-hana-large-instance-expressroute-circuits"></a>Applying ExpressRoute Fast Path to existing HANA Large Instance ExpressRoute circuits
The documentation so far explained how to connect a new ExpressRoute circuit that got created with a HANA Large Instance deployment to an Azure ExpressRoute gateway of one of your Azure virtual networks. But many customers already have their ExpressRoute circuits setup already and have their virtual networks connected to HANA Large Instances already. As the new ExpressRoute Fast Path is reducing network latency, it is recommended that you apply the change to use this functionality. The commands to connect a new ExpreesRoute circuit and to change an existing ExpressRoute Circuit are the same. As a result you need to run this sequence of PowerShell commands to change an existing circuit to use 

```powershell
# Populate with information provided by Microsoft Onboarding team
$PeerID = "/subscriptions/9cb43037-9195-4420-a798-f87681a0e380/resourceGroups/Customer-USE-Circuits/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/Customer-USE01"
$AuthGUID = "76d40466-c458-4d14-adcf-3d1b56d1cd61"

# Your ExpressRoute Gateway information
$myGroupName = "SAP-East-Coast"
$myGWName = "VNet01GW"
$myGWLocation = "East US"

# Define the name for your connection
$myConnectionName = "VNet01GWConnection"

# Create a new connection between the ER Circuit and your Gateway using the Authorization
$gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $myGWName -ResourceGroupName $myGroupName
    
New-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name $myConnectionName `
-ResourceGroupName $myGroupName -Location $myGWLocation -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $gw `
-PeerId $PeerID -ConnectionType ExpressRoute -AuthorizationKey $AuthGUID -ExpressRouteGatewayBypass
```

It is important that you add the last parameter as displayed above to enable the ExpressRoute Fast Path functionality


## <a name="expressroute-global-reach"></a>ExpressRoute Global Reach
As you want to enable Global Reach for one or both of the two scenarios:

 - HANA System Replication without any additional proxies or firewalls
 - Copying backups between HANA Large Instance units in two different regions to perform system copies or system refreshes

you need consider that:

- You need to provide an address space range of a /29 address space. That address range may not overlap with any of the other address space ranges that you used so far connecting HANA Large Instances to Azure and may not overlap with any of your IP address ranges you used somewhere else in Azure or on-premises.
- There is a limitation on the ASNs (Autonomous System Number) that can be used to advertise your on-premises routes to HANA Large Instances. Your on-premises must not advertise any routes with private ASNs in the range of 65000 – 65020 or 65515. 
- For the scenario of connecting on-premises direct access to HANA Large instances, you need to calculate a fee for the circuit that connects you to Azure. For prices, check the prices for [Global Reach Add-On](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/expressroute/).

To get one or both of the scenarios applied to your deployment, open a support message with Azure as described in [Open a support request for HANA large Instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-li-portal#open-a-support-request-for-hana-large-instances)

Data that is needed and keywords that you need to use for Microsoft to be able to route and execute on your request, looks like:

- Service: SAP HANA Large Instance
- Problem type: Configuration and Setup
- Problem subtype: My problem is not listed above
- Subject 'Modify my Network - add Global Reach'
- Details: 'Add Global Reach to HANA Large Instance to HANA Large Instance tenant or 'Add Global Reach to on-premises to HANA Large Instance tenant.
- Additional details for the HANA Large Instance to HANA Large Instance tenant case: You need to define the **two Azure regions** where the two tenants to connect are located **AND** you need to submit the **/29 IP address range**
- Additional details for the on-premises to HANA Large Instance tenant case: You need to define the **Azure Region** where the HANA Large Instance tenant is deployed you want to connect to directly. Additionally you need to provide the **Auth GUID** and **Circuit Peer ID** that you received when you established your ExpressRoute circuit between on-premises and Azure. Additionally, you need to name your **ASN**. The last deliverable is a **/29 IP address range** for ExpressRoute Global Reach.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to have both cases handled, you need to supply two different /29 IP address ranges that do not overlap with any other IP address range used so far.
